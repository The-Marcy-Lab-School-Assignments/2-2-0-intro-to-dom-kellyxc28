# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

To start off, `.createElement`, is used to create an element. Once this is done, attributes of the element, like `innerHTML`, can be accessed and manipulated. `innerHTML` is used to add or update the text in the element we make.

I guess technically you are not wrong! You are correct in that we could use these two methods in this way. I do want to mention however that if we use `.innerHTML`, we do not need to create elements since we would just write it in the HTML. This method is typically used to overwrite HTML like if we wanted to reset the page to a specific layout etc. Whereas `.createElement` will allow us to to have access to an element and make it more dynamic.
