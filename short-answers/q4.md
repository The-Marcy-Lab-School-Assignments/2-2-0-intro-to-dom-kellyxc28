# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

To start off, `.createElement`, is used to create an element. Once this is done, attributes of the element, like `innerHTML`, can be accessed and manipulated. `innerHTML` is used to add or update the text in the element we make.
