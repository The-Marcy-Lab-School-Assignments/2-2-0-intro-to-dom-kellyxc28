# Question

Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer

HTMLCollections involves only HTML elements while NodeLists includes all of the elements within the HTML document, even comments. Both of them are not arrays so array methods cannot be used on them. However, a perk of using NodeLists is that it can be turned into and used as an array.
